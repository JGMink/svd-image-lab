    "# Image Decomposition using SVD\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for image decomposition. SVD is a powerful technique in linear algebra that can be used for various applications, including image compression and noise reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of SVD\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a matrix \( A \) (in our case, an image), SVD allows us to decompose it into three matrices:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ A = U \\Sigma V^T \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "- \( U \) contains the left singular vectors.\n",
    "- \( \\Sigma \) is a diagonal matrix containing singular values.\n",
    "- \( V^T \) contains the right singular vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "By truncating the matrices \( U \), \( \\Sigma \), and \( V^T \), we can reconstruct an approximation of the original image with reduced rank, which can lead to compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Decompose an Image\n",
    "1. Load the image.\n",
    "2. Convert the image to grayscale (if necessary).\n",
    "3. Apply SVD to the image matrix.\n",
    "4. Reconstruct the image using a specified number of singular values.\n",
    "5. Visualize the original and decomposed images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and loading an image."
