    "## What is SVD?\n",
    "\n",
    "SVD is a factorization of a real or complex matrix. It is expressed as:\n",

    "\\[ A = U \\Sigma V^T \\]\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "- **A** is the original matrix.\n",
    "- **U** is an orthogonal matrix whose columns are the left singular vectors.\n",
    "- **\\Sigma** is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values.\n",
    "- **V^T** is the transpose of an orthogonal matrix whose columns are the right singular vectors.\n",
