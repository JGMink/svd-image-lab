    "# Notebook 3: Comparing Image De-Enhancement Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we compare two major approaches to \"de-enhancing\" or simplifying an image:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pixel Downsampling (Resolution Reduction)**  \n",
    "   - The real-world way of reducing resolution.  \n",
    "   - Literally decreases the number of pixels by resizing the image.  \n",
    "   - Results in a blocky, pixelated look.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SVD Truncation (Singular Value Dropping)**  \n",
    "   - A linear algebra method using the Singular Value Decomposition.  \n",
    "   - Instead of reducing pixel count, we drop some singular values that represent fine details.  \n",
    "   - Produces a smoother, blurred look instead of blockiness.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll apply both methods to the same images and discuss why you might use one method or the other."

    "- **Pixel Downsampling** reduces resolution directly.  \n",
    "  - Fast, simple, and widely used.  \n",
    "  - Produces blocky, pixelated results.  \n",
    "  - Useful for storage savings, ML preprocessing, or simulating low-res devices.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **SVD Truncation** reduces *detail* rather than pixel count.  \n",
    "  - Keeps structure, loses fine detail.  \n",
    "  - Produces smoother, blurred images.  \n",
    "  - Useful for compression, denoising, and analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use each?\n",
    "- Use **downsampling** when you care about resolution, file size, or speed.  \n",
    "- Use **SVD truncation** when you want to smooth/compress while keeping the main structure intact.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, they show two complementary ways of \"de-enhancement\":  \n",
    "one pixel-based, one linear-algebra-based."
