# SVD Image Lab

## Overview
The SVD Image Lab project is designed to explore the concepts of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and its applications in image processing. This project provides tools for image decomposition, reconstruction, and analysis using SVD, along with visualizations and performance metrics.

## Mathematical Concepts
Singular Value Decomposition is a mathematical technique used in linear algebra to factorize a matrix into three other matrices. For a given matrix \( A \), SVD can be expressed as:

\[ A = U \Sigma V^T \]

Where:
- \( U \) is an orthogonal matrix containing the left singular vectors.
- \( \Sigma \) is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values.
- \( V^T \) is the transpose of an orthogonal matrix containing the right singular vectors.

The singular values in \( \Sigma \) provide insight into the importance of each corresponding singular vector, which can be utilized for dimensionality reduction and image compression.

## Examples
The project includes several Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the use of SVD in image processing:

1. **01_svd_basics.ipynb**: Introduces the basics of SVD with theoretical explanations and examples.
2. **02_image_decomposition.ipynb**: Shows how to apply SVD for image decomposition, allowing for the reconstruction of images from their singular values.
3. **03_metrics_and_analysis.ipynb**: Analyzes the results of SVD on images and discusses various performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).

## Running the Code
To run the code in this project, you will need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the dependencies, you can open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the examples and experiments.
